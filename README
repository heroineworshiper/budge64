ported to the Commodore 64 by

Compile with make.  Run with ./budge.sh on VICE
The BASIC arrays have been ported to assembly in tables.s: CODE_arr
This uses the userport printer in VICE for debugging.

Couldn't find any source code for the demo shown on youtube so instead
it just animates 1 of the objects.  

budge.s, tables.s: Original 28 angle steps
budge2.s, tables2.s: 127 angle steps
    Uncomment DOUBLE_SIZE to double the model size
    Uncomment USE_XOR to use XOR to clear the screen instead of memset
    XOR is slower than clearing the screen for all but the smallest model
    There are 2 shuttle animations & 1 cube animation enabled with macros.

tables.py: creates the angle tables in tables2.s
